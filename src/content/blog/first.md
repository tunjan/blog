description: First week's post

As expected from my previous endeavors, I find myself in total reluctance of writing this first post. In part, it is due to my awareness
of not being in the mindset of careful and delightful writing. But looking more introspectively, I realize that it might be more correlated to the feeling of
self-judgement at my writing. In any case, I was not aiming for the reader to find great value in these posts, but just to keep me, in some way, accountable.

I fail to remember what was I learning at the start of the week. Therefore, as a lesson, moving forward I will keep track of what I have been reading.
A significant portion my time has been spent (or otherwise invested) in reading LessWrong posts. I have found in them inspiration and motivation to keep
improving my rationality toolkit. Sometimes it feels relieving to know that there are other fellow humans who value the same things as I do. One of the posts
particularly attracted my attention, it dealt with the topic of [sexual dimorphism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA8DWsHJeFZhDcQuo/the-talk-a-brief-explanation-of-sexual-dimorphism) and how it feels within the evolution paradigm.

I have also been delving into topics like formal logic and probability theory. However, I have found myself to be changing daily from subject to subject and it did not
result in a positive outcome. It feels as if the way of thinking did not get into my intuition because I have not spent enough continuous time thinking about it. As an example, I can remember that when I studied Newtonian physics and spent a great deal of time thinking during problem-solving, it got to the point where I was not
leaving my Newtonian hat at the faculty, but had it even until I reached home. And now, even after a few years I am able to put that hat again as needed. Whereas, with
probability, because I have studied it intermittently and not deeply enough, I have not developed the ability to wear the hat. I hope this analogy comes through to the reader.

Much of this week I have also spent in learning MLOps, as I am doing a course to potentially be a machine learning engineer. It is not the most interesting of topics
to be reading about, since it is more of a know-how to use software developed by big companies, instead of learning the fundamentals of a new science. Nonetheless, it
is something I find myself comfortable doing as it requires experience in GNU/Linux systems, which I have acquired over the past four years.

Some ideas I have for next week's post is uploading some of the problems I have had most trouble solving or have found particularly amusing to solve.

Finally, I list some of the books I have been reading this week:

A concise introduction to Logic
Designing Machine Learning Systems
Fundamentals Of Probability
